# NASA 2025 Solaria

This repository contains the solution for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge, named *"Embiggen Your Eyes!"*

## Summary

While your cell phone screen can display about three million pixels of information and your eye can receive more than ten million pixels, NASA images from space are even bigger! NASA’s space missions continue to push the boundaries of what is technologically possible, providing high-resolution images and videos of Earth, other planets, and space with billions or even trillions of pixels. Your challenge is to create a platform that allows users to zoom in and out on these massive image datasets, label known features, and discover new patterns.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
