# Solaria Front-End Requirements

This document outlines the **front-end requirements** for the **Solaria** platform — a web-based application for exploring NASA’s massive image datasets.

---

## 1. User Interface (UI)

- Responsive and intuitive design suitable for **researchers, students, and the general public**.
- **Zooming and panning controls** similar to map applications (e.g., Google Maps).
- Minimalistic layout with clear focus on the imagery.
- Support for **desktop, tablet, and mobile devices**.
- Accessibility features (contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support).

---

## 2. Visualization & Rendering

- Deep-zoom rendering of **gigapixel or terabyte-scale images** using **tile-based image streaming**.
- Smooth, **real-time zooming and panning**.
- Support for **multiple image layers**, including different wavelengths, instruments, or time frames.
- Integration with **WebGL, OpenSeadragon, or similar libraries** for high-performance rendering.
- Adaptive loading to ensure fast interaction without downloading entire datasets.

---

## 3. Image Interaction Features

- **Annotation tools**:
  - Add, edit, and remove markers.
  - Label known features (e.g., craters, mountains, galaxies).
  - Save and export annotations.
- **Layer overlays**:
  - Toggle visibility of different datasets.
  - Compare multiple layers side by side or overlaid.
- **Time slider** for temporal comparison of images.
- **AI-assisted search**:
  - Locate features using keywords or semantic descriptions.
  - Navigate directly to coordinates or named locations.

## 4. Data Handling

- **Progressive tile loading** to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Lazy loading** and caching for smooth performance.
- Compatible with **NASA APIs and publicly available datasets**.
- Ability to switch datasets without page reload.
- Handle multiple formats (e.g., visible light, infrared, altimeter data).

---

## 5. Interactive Features

- Clickable hotspots with pop-ups showing metadata or additional information.
- Hover effects for feature highlights.
- **Pan and zoom history** for easy navigation back to previous views.
- Optional **full-screen mode** for immersive exploration.

---

## 6. Performance & Scalability

- Optimized for **low-latency interaction** even with gigapixel images.
- Efficient memory management to prevent browser crashes.
- Support for **streaming from cloud servers** to avoid large downloads.
- Adaptable rendering depending on device performance (dynamic tile resolution).

---

## 7. Integration & Extensibility

- Modular design to **support future datasets** (Earth, Moon, Mars, galaxies).
- Easy addition of new annotation types, AI-powered tools, or layer types.
- Compatible with potential **VR/AR extensions** for immersive exploration.
- Designed for integration with **backend APIs** for dynamic content updates.

---

## 8. User Experience (UX)

- Tooltips and onboarding guidance for first-time users.
- Easy switching between datasets and image layers.
- Clear indicators for zoom level, coordinates, and selected features.
- Smooth transitions when switching datasets or layers.
- Feedback mechanisms for reporting issues or suggesting features.

---

## 9. Deployment Considerations

- Fully hosted as a **web application** (example: Vercel deployment).
- Supports **modern browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities optional for offline exploration.

---

## 10. Technology Stack Recommendations

- **Frontend Framework**: React / Next.js
- **Rendering Libraries**: OpenSeadragon, WebGL, Deck.GL, Three.js
- **State Management**: Redux, Zustand, or React Context
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS or Material UI for responsive design
- **Data Handling**: Fetch API / Axios for API integration, caching strategies
- **Annotations & Interactivity**: Canvas/SVG overlays

---

## ✅ Notes

The front-end requirements prioritize:

- **Ease of use** for both public audiences and researchers.
- **High-performance rendering** for extremely large image datasets.
- **Extensibility** for future NASA data and features.
- **Cross-device compatibility** for widespread accessibility.
